How will my past and coding combined give me an advantage? Well, I never really thought about it. I think 
my customer service background coupled with my Early Childhood Developement backgroud may play a significant role
in my future career. Putting the Customer/Client first and patience could be helpful in a developer job setting. 
These two characteristics could open up more doors or possibly provide me a higher salary if I apply these
skills and market them properly.

I aim to please, or I'm a control freak that has to have every little detail right. No matter the case, it serves 
my client well. To me, it's pointless to do anything if your not going to give it 100%. 110% if you have the time.
Consumers pay good money to receive products that do exactly what they are supposed to do. If you hire me, that is 
exactly what I want to give you, what you want and when you want it. That should help or be an advantage when choosing
my new career. Great Customer Service.

I play it safe and leave room for error when caring for kiddos. When a parent outlines their expectations for me as
a provider, that is the law. They are trusting me with their precious cargo and I refuse to stray away from the plan.
Also, things can't always be perfect so I try to include enough time for unexpected potty breaks, spills, falls 
or extra cuddles when they're sad. I can only imagine that following directions and creating cushions will add to my 
success in my new career.

In conclusion, I feel that even though my background has very little to do with coding, I can still apply some of
my experiences to it. My ability to meet/exceed the customers needs, stay on course and care should give me a little 
advantage in my new career.
